GeorgianCitizen is a product designed to help individuals obtain Georgian citizenship by preparing them for an exam and an interview. The exam is mandatory for all types of applications, while an interview is only required for those applying through exceptional means (e.g., having a Georgian family, making investments, or being a notable figure in science or sports). The interview will be conducted in person and in Georgian.

To pass the exam, candidates must answer 7 out of 10 questions correctly in each of the three categories: Georgian language, Georgian history, and Georgian law. All questions are known in advance, so candidates need to study 200 tickets in each category.

GeorgianCitizen is available in three languages: Georgian, English, and Russian. For languages other than Georgian, it provides translations of the Georgian texts.

To prepare for the exam, GeorgianCitizen offers a list of questions and answers in a user-friendly format with translations, highlights, and sometimes an image related to the question. As users progress, they can mark questions as learned. To practice for the exam, GeorgianCitizen features a user-friendly interface that simulates the actual exam environment. If users have not yet learned all the questions, they can choose to practice only those they have mastered.

Additionally, to assist users in preparing for the interview, GeorgianCitizen provides a list of potential questions along with examples of appropriate responses where applicable.
